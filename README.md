## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages: `random`, `math`, `typing`, `json`

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/math-question-generator.git
cd math-question-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from math_generator import MathQuestionGenerator

generator = MathQuestionGenerator()
assessment = generator.generate_assessment(
    title="Quantitative Math Practice Test",
    description="Comprehensive assessment covering coordinate geometry and problem solving"
)
print(assessment)
```

## üìñ Question Format

Each generated question follows this exact format:

```
@title Assessment title
@description Assessment description

@question Write your question here
@instruction Write instruction here  
@difficulty easy,moderate,hard
@Order Question number
@option write first option here
@option Write second option here
@@option Correct Answer
@option option
@explanation 
Write your question explanation here
@subject Write subject of the question here
@unit Write unit of the subject
@topic Write topic of the question
@plusmarks 1
```

## üß† Question Types Generated

### 1. Coordinate Geometry Questions
- Parallelogram completion problems
- Distance and midpoint calculations
- Slope and line equations
- Geometric transformations

**Example:**
```
In the coordinate plane, triangle ABC has vertices at A(-2, 4), B(6, 1), and C(2, -3). 
If point D is located such that ABCD forms a parallelogram, what are the coordinates of point D?
```

### 2. Complex Word Problems  
- Multi-step percentage problems
- Profit and markup calculations
- Rate and proportion problems
- Real-world applications

**Example:**
```
A bakery sells cupcakes in boxes. Each box contains 18 cupcakes and costs $12.60. 
If the bakery needs to make a profit of 40% on each box and the cost to make each 
cupcake is $0.35, what should be the selling price per individual cupcake when sold 
separately?
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### Custom Question Generation
```python
# Generate specific question types
coord_question = generator.generate_coordinate_geometry_question()
word_question = generator.generate_word_problem_question()

# Format according to standards
formatted = generator.format_question_output(coord_question, 1)
```

### Curriculum Validation
The system ensures all questions align with the provided curriculum structure:
- Validates subject-unit-topic hierarchy
- Maintains educational standards
- Ensures appropriate difficulty progression

### Explanation Generation
Each question includes comprehensive explanations:
- Step-by-step solution process
- Mathematical reasoning
- Alternative solution methods
- Common mistake identification

## üìä Quality Assurance

- **Mathematical Accuracy**: All calculations verified through multiple methods
- **Curriculum Alignment**: Strict adherence to provided curriculum standards  
- **Format Compliance**: Perfect matching of required output format
- **Difficulty Calibration**: Appropriate challenge level for target audience
- **Explanation Quality**: Clear, educational explanations with proper mathematical notation

## üé® Image Generation Support

The system is designed to work with mathematical figure generation:
- Coordinate plane visualizations
- Geometric shape illustrations  
- Graph and chart representations
- Diagram annotations and labels
